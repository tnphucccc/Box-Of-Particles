A box with random particles moving inside
- This is a lab assignment for my OOP course at HCMIU
- My first time using ArrayList and Enum

## About the lab
We have a box to store particles. Initially place 3 particles in the box randomly. After each step, these particles will move freely inside the box. If 2 particles collide, there will be a new particle placed randomly in the box.
